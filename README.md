Here is the code I used to compile a Wikipedia corpus, preprocessing, topic modeling
***
 **wikiscrap** contains 4 functions for creating a comparable corpora using Wikipedia (I used the Wikipedia-API library). You get txt files.
 
 **preprocess** contains functions for preprocessing texts in russian and english. 
 
 **BasicLDAmethods** contains code for experiments with a comparable corpora using a standart LDA model from the gensim library
 
 **pd2txt** is used to create files with all documnets in english and russian corpora which then can be used for using polylingual topic model (PLTM) from the MALLET package (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics-polylingual.php)
